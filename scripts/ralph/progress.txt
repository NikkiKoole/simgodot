## Codebase Patterns
- Tests are in scenes/tests/*.tscn (scenes) and scripts/tests/*.gd (code)
- Run tests with: "/Users/nikkikoole/Downloads/Godot 3.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot" --headless scenes/tests/test_*.tscn
- Or run all tests: ./run_tests.sh
- ItemEntity states: RAW, PREPPED, COOKED, DIRTY, BROKEN
- ItemEntity locations: IN_CONTAINER, IN_HAND, IN_SLOT, ON_GROUND
- Station.place_output_item() adds items as children of station
- Items falling back to ground use station.global_position for placement
- JobBoard autoload is at /root/JobBoard (NOT /root/Main/JobBoard)
- When creating test JobBoards, use free() not queue_free() to avoid stale node conflicts
- Level.all_items tracks all spawned items in the level
- Item reservation: item.reserve_item(agent) / item.release_item() / item.is_reserved()

## Key Files for Ground Item Feature
- scripts/level.gd: Has all_items array and get_ground_items_by_tag() (US-001 complete)
- scripts/station.gd: Has output_slots and get_available_output_items_by_tag() (US-002 complete)
- scripts/job_board.gd: can_start_job() and _reserve_items_for_job() check all sources (US-003, US-004 complete)
- scripts/npc.gd: _find_item_source() finds items from containers, stations, ground (US-005 complete)
- scripts/item_entity.gd: Already has location enum and reservation - no changes needed

## 2026-01-10 - US-001
- What was implemented: Added Level.get_ground_items_by_tag(tag: String) -> Array[ItemEntity] method
- Files changed:
  - scripts/level.gd: Added get_ground_items_by_tag() method
  - scripts/tests/test_ground_items.gd: New test file with 7 test cases (22 assertions)
  - scenes/tests/test_ground_items.tscn: New test scene
  - run_tests.sh: Added test_ground_items to test suite
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GDScript type inference with `:=` fails when the source method is on a dynamically-typed variable (e.g., `level: Node2D`). Use explicit type annotations like `var result: Array[ItemEntity] = level.method()` instead.
  - Level.add_item() returns ItemEntity and automatically sets location to ON_GROUND and adds to all_items array.
  - Test scenes for Level use TestLevel node (empty level with world_map="" and auto_spawn_npcs=false) as parent, with TestRunner as child.

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented: Added Station.get_available_output_items_by_tag(tag: String) -> Array[ItemEntity] method
- Files changed:
  - scripts/station.gd: Added get_available_output_items_by_tag() method (8 lines)
  - scripts/tests/test_station.gd: Added 5 test cases for US-002 (18 assertions), also fixed missing `await` on async test calls
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Test functions containing `await` must be called with `await` in run_tests() or execution will skip them
  - Station.output_slot_items is a Dictionary mapping slot_index -> ItemEntity
  - Simple query methods can iterate output_slot_items.values() directly

## 2026-01-10 - US-003
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented: Extended JobBoard.can_start_job() to check ground items and station output slots
- Files changed:
  - scripts/job_board.gd: Modified can_start_job() to accept optional level parameter, check station outputs and ground items for both inputs and tools
  - scripts/tests/test_jobboard.gd: Added 6 new test cases (MockLevel class, tests for ground items, station outputs, combined sources, reserved items, partial sources, backward compatibility)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - can_start_job() now has optional 4th parameter `level: Node = null` for backward compatibility
  - If level is null, tries to get it via `get_tree().current_scene`
  - Use `has_method("get_ground_items_by_tag")` to check if level supports ground item queries
  - Order of item discovery: containers first, then station outputs, then ground items
  - Tools are also searched in station outputs and ground items (not just containers)

## 2026-01-10 - US-004
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented: Extended JobBoard._reserve_items_for_job() and claim_job() to reserve items from all sources (containers, station outputs, ground items)
- Files changed:
  - scripts/job_board.gd: Modified _reserve_items_for_job() to accept optional stations and level parameters, reserve from all sources with priority order (containers > stations > ground). Updated claim_job() to pass new parameters.
  - scripts/tests/test_jobboard.gd: Added 6 new test cases for US-004 (38 assertions): test_reserve_from_container, test_reserve_from_ground, test_reserve_from_station_output, test_reserve_prefers_container, test_reserve_multiple_sources, test_reserve_prevents_double_claim
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - claim_job() now accepts optional 4th and 5th parameters: `stations: Array = []` and `level: Node = null`
  - _reserve_items_for_job() uses same priority order as can_start_job(): containers first, then station outputs, then ground items
  - GDScript type inference with `:=` fails when calling methods with multiple optional parameters - use explicit `var claimed: bool = board.claim_job(...)` instead
  - Reservation prevents double-claiming: item.reserve_item(agent) returns false if already reserved by another agent

## 2026-01-10 - US-005
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented: Added NPC._find_item_source(tag: String) -> Dictionary method to locate items from any source
- Files changed:
  - scripts/npc.gd: Added _find_item_source() method (returns {type, source} dict) and _get_level() helper method
  - scripts/tests/test_find_item_source.gd: New test file with 7 test cases (14 assertions)
  - scenes/tests/test_find_item_source.tscn: New test scene
  - run_tests.sh: Added test_find_item_source to test suite
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - _find_item_source() returns Dictionary with 'type' (string) and 'source' (node/null) keys
  - type values: 'container', 'station_output', 'ground', 'none'
  - source is: ItemContainer, Station, ItemEntity (for ground), or null
  - Priority order matches JobBoard: containers first, then station outputs, then ground items
  - Method respects reservations: finds unreserved items OR items reserved by self (when current_job != null)
  - When passing empty typed arrays in tests, use explicit type: `var empty: Array[ItemContainer] = []` not just `[]`
  - _get_level() helper tries current_scene first, then parent node - allows flexibility in test setup
